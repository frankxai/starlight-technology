# Starlight Technology Repository Instructions

## Product

Starlight Technology is the buying-intelligence and complete-system design platform for AI-native creators and small teams. The initial campaign is AI Creator Studio.

## Workspace

- Canonical repo: `C:/Users/frank/starlight/repos/starlight-technology`
- Never use `C:/Users/frank/universe`.
- Never recursively search `C:/`, `C:/Users/frank`, home, Desktop, Documents, Downloads, OneDrive, This PC, or Phone/MTP paths. Restrict all searches to this repo or another explicit leaf.
- Before writes, verify Git top-level, origin, and branch.

## Product boundaries

- `frankx.ai/stack` owns Frank's personal “what I use and why” content.
- This repo owns market-wide comparisons, complete builds, evidence records, decision models, and regional offer intelligence.
- Do not duplicate FrankX articles or present research-only conclusions as hands-on testing.
- Do not publish prices without a verification timestamp and merchant-policy-compliant source.

## Engineering

- Next.js App Router, TypeScript strict mode, server-first components.
- Keep product/editorial data typed and source-backed.
- Prefer static generation and ISR; do not call merchant APIs during page requests.
- Do not add databases, paid services, tracking vendors, account systems, or merchant feeds before an explicit product need and cost/privacy decision.
- No secrets in Git. Never inspect or print `.env` values.
- Run `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm build` before handoff.

## Design

Apply the Starlight design pack and the estate premium asset gate. The first viewport must show a real decision object or system artifact, not generic gradients, node/orbit imagery, fake dashboards, or decorative glass cards. Use clear hierarchy, restrained motion, reduced-motion support, keyboard focus, and intentional mobile composition.

Important visual changes require `design-loop-evidence.json`, desktop/mobile inspection, and a score of at least 26/30.

## GitOps

- Draft-first PRs.
- Group meaningful changes; do not push tiny churn.
- Verify locally before triggering Vercel.
- One deploy path: Vercel native Git integration after project connection.
- Do not merge or promote production without verified gates.
